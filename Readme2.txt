As part of the security assessment, a focused manual review was conducted to evaluate the application’s authentication mechanisms and associated trust boundaries. The objective of this assessment was to identify potential weaknesses in the authentication flow, including improper handling of identity provider interactions, insufficient validation of authentication parameters, susceptibility to authentication bypass, and exposure to token or session-related attacks. Testing concentrated on critical authentication endpoints, redirect and callback handling, parameter integrity, and enforcement of security controls such as issuer validation, authentication flow consistency, and protection against replay and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). The assessment was performed in a controlled test environment using a combination of manual inspection and targeted request manipulation to validate the robustness of the authentication implementation against common real-world attack scenarios.
