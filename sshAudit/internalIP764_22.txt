[0;33m(nfo) Be aware that, while this target properly supports the strict key exchange method (via the kex-strict-?-v00@openssh.com marker) needed to protect against the Terrapin vulnerability (CVE-2023-48795), all peers must also support this feature as well, otherwise the vulnerability will still be present.  The following algorithms would allow an unpatched peer to create vulnerable SSH channels with this target: chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com.  If any CBC ciphers are in this list, you may remove them while leaving the *-etm@openssh.com MACs in place; these MACs are fine while paired with non-CBC cipher types.[0m
